## üì¶ Prerequisites

Before using **Game Store Library Manager**, install:

- [Runtime .NET 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime)  
- [Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/#download-section)

---
Open the "https://github.com/Aynshe/GSLM/releases/latest" archive and unzip the folders to the root of RetroBat.

For the first run, you can directly execute "GameStoreLibraryManager.exe." The menu will open to enable the desired features. Be careful, if you enable the "Media Scraping" option, processing times can be very long depending on the number of games on the different stores. It is not recommended to open RetroBat at this point, as this may create duplicate entries in the game lists.

If you don't want GameStoreLibraryManager.exe to run for refresh every time you open RetroBat and every time you update the game list, you need to delete both .bat file \emulationstation\.emulationstation\scripts\start\GameStoreLibraryManager-wait.bat and \emulationstation\.emulationstation\scripts\update-gamelists\GameStoreLibraryManager-wait.bat

## ‚öôÔ∏è Main Features

- **üìÇ Loading Installation Files**  
  Adds the installation launchers to RetroBat by store folders.  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è For **Steam**, disable RetroBat‚Äôs internal option to avoid duplicates.

  - For **Steam**, it also copies the API key.

    - via the shortcut in the store folder  
    - or with:
      ```bash
      GameStoreLibraryManager.exe -menu
      ```
      
###  **Prefer enabling one API generation at a time ‚Üí **save ‚Üí refresh RetroBat** **"But it is best to run the first API connections and scraping outside of RetroBat (launch GameStoreLibraryManager.exe after enabling an API)!"****


- **üîí Security (recommended)**  
  **DPAPI** option ‚Üí encrypts tokens and the Steam API key, usable only on the current Windows session.  
  ‚ÑπÔ∏è Automatic token renewal duration: **unknown**.

- **üéÆ Loading Executables of Installed Games**  
  Already handled by RetroBat (**Steam, GOG, Epic, Amazon, EA Games**).  
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk of **conflict** or **different names** if used in parallel.

- **üñºÔ∏è Media and Metadata Scraping**  
  - Sources: **HFSPlay** and **Steam** (Steam preferred by default)
